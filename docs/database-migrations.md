# Database migrations

The v0.3.0 series introduces a structured recall-feedback SQLite store
that runs **side-by-side** with the legacy audit-log feedback path. This
document explains how the schema is created, how new columns are added
to pre-existing databases, how legacy feedback is migrated, and which
invariants the database layer is **forbidden** to break — including the
no-physical-deletion hard contract that the rest of the OS depends on.

The authoritative code lives in `openclaw_memory_os/recall_feedback.py`.
The migration tests live in `tests/test_feedback_schema.py` and
`tests/test_evaluate_retrieval_script.py` (for the migration plumbing of
the offline CLI).

## Storage layout

The structured feedback database lives under
`$MEMORY_OS_RECALL_STATE_DIR` (default
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/openclaw-memory-os/`, fallback
`~/.local/state/openclaw-memory-os/`). It is a single SQLite file:

```text
recall_feedback.db
├── recall_runs        (one row per recall-test query)
├── recall_results     (one row per ranked hit)
└── feedback_events    (one row per thumbs-up / thumbs-down)
```

A second file `evolution-state.json` is stored in the same directory and
governs the weekly evolution cycle (see `docs/self-evolution.md`).
**Never** move these files inside the Qdrant or repository path — the
state directory is intentionally `~/.local/state` so an uninstall does
not destroy operator-owned signals.

## Schema and the migration contract

`_ensure_schema(conn)` in `recall_feedback.py` is the single entry point
for the schema. It is:

* **Idempotent.** Running it twice is a no-op. Each new column is
  declared in `_SCHEMA_COLUMNS` and is checked against
  `PRAGMA table_info(table)` before being added.
* **Backward-compatible.** Fresh databases receive the new columns
  inline in `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`. Pre-existing databases
  receive them via `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ...` guarded by the
  `table_info` check.
* **Failure-tolerant.** A SQLite race where two callers race on the
  same migration is logged and treated as success (`duplicate column
  name` is the only known race).
* **Auditable.** Each migration is reproducible: the `_SCHEMA_COLUMNS`
  tuple is the ordered, named source of truth. Adding a new column
  means appending a triple `(table, column, sql_type)` to that tuple;
  removing one means leaving it in place but adding a guard to skip.

The current `_SCHEMA_COLUMNS` tuple lives at the top of
`recall_feedback.py`. New fields are added in v0.3.0.x releases only
after the offline evaluator and the dashboard have learned to ignore
them (a missing column means "no judgement yet", never an error).

## Retention policy

* **`recall_runs`** — 180-day retention. Rows older than that are pruned
  by `_retention_cleanup()`. Pruning is intentionally **safe**: the
  deletion only targets `recall_runs`; child rows in `recall_results`
  stay (joined via FK) and `feedback_events` rows are kept
  **indefinitely** because they are the only source of truth for what
  the user actually wanted. Pruning `feedback_events` would silently
  bias the offline evaluation pipeline.
* **`recall_results`** — kept as long as the parent `recall_runs` row
  lives (FK cascade is enabled via `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`). The
  retention cleanup currently leaves `recall_results` orphan-safe: any
  row whose parent was deleted is preserved.
* **`feedback_events`** — never auto-pruned.

Operators who need stricter retention must edit
`_RECALL_RUNS_RETENTION_DAYS` and ship a custom build; there is **no**
runtime env var that bypasses the 180-day default because feedback
retention is the contract that the offline evaluator depends on.

## Migration runner — recall feedback

The legacy v0.2.x feedback path stored thumbs-up / thumbs-down as
`action="feedback"` rows in the audit log. v0.3.0 introduced the
structured SQLite tables. `migrate_legacy_feedback()` is the
authoritative migration entry point:

```text
openclaw_memory_os.recall_feedback.migrate_legacy_feedback() -> int
```

It reads every `action="feedback"` audit row, parses the legacy
`detail` string for `(query, memory_id, useful)`, and upserts the row
into `feedback_events` with `feedback_source="migrated"` and
`migration_status="migrated:audit"`. The legacy audit rows are left
**read-only**: the function never deletes or edits them.

Properties:

* **Idempotent.** Each legacy row is keyed by `(query, memory_id,
  created_at)`; re-running the function is a no-op on already-migrated
  rows.
* **Bounded.** The function never opens Qdrant, never calls the
  embedder, never blocks on the network.
* **Auditable.** Each migrated row carries `migration_status =
  "migrated:audit"`, so operators can filter for provenance in
  ad-hoc queries.

The function is also exposed via the CLI:

```bash
python -c "from openclaw_memory_os.recall_feedback import migrate_legacy_feedback; print(migrate_legacy_feedback())"
```

## Adding a new column

To add a new column to one of the three structured-feedback tables,
follow the recipe below. **Do not** rewrite the existing tuples — append
to them.

1. Identify which table the column belongs to (`recall_runs`,
   `recall_results`, `feedback_events`).
2. Choose a SQL type (`TEXT` / `INTEGER` / `REAL`).
3. Append `(table, column, sql_type)` to `_SCHEMA_COLUMNS` in
   `recall_feedback.py`. The order matters: the schema migration runs
   in tuple order on pre-existing databases.
4. Add an optional default to the `record_recall_*` writer that
   populates the field. Make the default `None` / `""` so existing
   callers don't have to be updated.
5. Update `EvalResult.to_dict()` and the `/api/dashboard/evaluation`
   shape to surface the new field.
6. Update this document with the column's purpose and its default.

A complete example lives in the v0.3.0.x history:

* `recall_runs.query_hash`, `corpus_snapshot_id`, `dense_available`,
  `lexical_available`, `collections_succeeded_json`,
  `collections_failed_json`.
* `recall_results.vector_score_raw`, `vector_score_calibrated`,
  `lexical_score_raw`, `lexical_score_calibrated`, `importance_score`,
  `recency_score`, `feedback_score`, `display_score`.
* `feedback_events.migration_status`.

## Migration runner — adding tables

There is currently **one** structured-feedback database (the SQLite file
above). The legacy audit store is separate and survives every
migration. If you ever introduce a second table or a second database:

1. Place it under `$MEMORY_OS_RECALL_STATE_DIR/openclaw-memory-os/`.
2. Reuse `_ensure_schema()` with its own `_SCHEMA_COLUMNS` tuple. The
   existing pattern is intentionally copyable rather than abstracted
   — the second table just gets its own `_SCHEMA_COLUMNS` and its own
   `_ensure_schema()`.
3. Document the new file in this document under a new section so
   operators can find it on a fresh install.

## Hard contract: no physical delete

The OS is forbidden from physically deleting memory records. The
contract lives in `openclaw_memory_os/contracts.py` as
`NO_PHYSICAL_DELETION` (and is re-asserted in the `HARD_CONTRACTS`
tuple).

This database-migrations document does **not** soften that rule. The
allowed operations on the **memory record** are:

* `supersede` — a new record replaces the old via the same
  candidate-key; the old one is flagged `status="superseded"`.
* `expire` — the record's `status` becomes `expired`.
* `archive` — the record is moved to an "archive" collection or
  annotation.
* `dedupe` — two near-duplicate records are merged into one; the loser
  is **superseded**, never deleted.

The retention cleanup in `_retention_cleanup()` is **not** a violation
of this rule because:

* It only deletes `recall_runs` rows (audit-style trace data).
* It never touches memory records, `recall_results` rows that
  referenced the deleted run, or `feedback_events` rows that referenced
  the deleted run.
* The child `recall_results` rows survive the delete because FK
  cascade is intentionally off for `recall_runs` → `recall_results`
  (`PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON` only enforces the FK constraint; cascade
  behaviour is the SQLite default which is `RESTRICT` for a missing
  parent).

If you ever modify `_retention_cleanup()` to also prune `recall_results`
or `feedback_events`, the contract reviewer must:

1. Verify the offline evaluation pipeline still has enough signal.
2. Verify no dashboard surfaces a counter that depends on the deleted
   rows.
3. Document the change here **and** in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Cross-version compatibility

v0.3.0 → v0.3.0.x is forward-compatible. A v0.3.0 process that opens a
database written by v0.3.0.x will simply not see the new columns
(`SELECT *` returns them as `NULL` on SQLite versions that support
default-`NULL` columns). The reverse direction — v0.3.0.x opening a
v0.3.0 database — runs the `_ensure_schema()` migration silently the
first time the writer is called.

The legacy audit-log feedback path is **still readable** in both
directions. The `_parse_old_feedback()` helper preserves
backwards-compatible parsing so an audit row from v0.2.x migrates
cleanly into `feedback_events`.

## Forensic notes for operators

* The schema is `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` and `PRAGMA
  foreign_keys=ON`. Operators running multi-process writers should
  keep WAL mode; do not edit it.
* Connections have `timeout=5` (5 seconds) to absorb transient lock
  contention. A contended lock raises `sqlite3.OperationalError`; the
  caller wraps it in a `with _lock:` so the write retried on the next
  request rather than blocking the event loop.
* `feedback_events` rows are preserved across all upgrades. Operators
  who need to **export** the signals (e.g. for offline research) can
  run a `sqlite3 -header -csv recall_feedback.db "SELECT * FROM
  feedback_events"` against the `~/.local/state/openclaw-memory-os/`
  directory; the export is non-destructive.
